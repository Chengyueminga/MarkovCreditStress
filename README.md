** Simulating Credit Risk Transitions under Stress: A Markov Approach**

This project simulates corporate credit rating migration and capital impact under stress scenarios using a **discrete-time Markov model**. It is designed to illustrate how credit quality deteriorates in a macroeconomic downturn and how this affects **downgrafe rates, default probabilities, and regulatory capital requirements**.

## Project Overview

- **Goal**: Model credit rating migration for a portofolio of 500 synthetic companies over 1 10-year horizon.
- **Methodology**: Uses **Markov transition matrices** to simulate rating paths under:
    - A **baseline matrix** (stable economy)
    - A **stress matrix** (economic downturn with elevated downgrade/default risk)
- **Output**: Visual and statistical comaprisons of:
    - Rating distributions over time
    - Cumulative default rates
    - Capital requirements under Basel-style assumptions

## Key Components

- `Section 2`: Construction of baseline and stress transition matrices  
- `Section 3`: Stress scenario impact visualization (rating paths, downgrade counts, default frequencies)
- `Section 4`: Estimation of regulatory capital needs using:

  - Simulated default rates
  - Assumed **Exposure at Default (EAD)** and **Risk Weights**
  - Capital ratio approximations

## ðŸ“Š Sample Visualizations

- Heatmaps of transition matrices  
- Bar charts of rating downgrades and defaults  
- Year-by-year capital impact comparisons

>  Note: All simulations are based on synthetic data for **educational and regulatory modeling purposes**.

##  Technical Details

- Language: Python (Jupyter Notebook)  
- Dependencies: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`  
- Simulation Type: Monte Carlo path-based transitions with yearly snapshots

##  Regulatory Context

This simulation mirrors **Basel III internal model frameworks**, where capital requirements depend on default probabilities and credit migration. The stress matrix is designed to mimic recessionary conditions, offering insight into **procyclicality and capital buffer needs** during downturns.
